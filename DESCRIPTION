Title: Gene Set Analysis with Quantitative Trait Loci for RNA-sequencing Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Samarendra Das
Maintainer: Samarendra Das <samarendra.das@louisville.edu>
Description: This package contains functions for gene set analysis (GSA) with Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) annotation data
    for gene expression data derived from Microarrays and RNA-sequencing studies. Further, it considers the differential expression
    scores of genes present in the gene set for performing GSA with QTL.
